        <p>I enjoy playing classical Carnatic music on the violin.</p>

        <h2>My Experience with Carnatic Music:</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="main">
        <ul>
            <li>Whatever one’s personal background and aspirations may be, Carnatic music remains a quest for undiluted
                aesthetic experience.</li>
            <li>It combines three main components - raaga, tala, and bhava to create stunning and soulful music.</li>
            <li>Rendering these melodies on my violin is a meditative experience that never fails to amaze me at the
                brilliance of Carnatic compositions.</li>
            <li>I first start with the technical aspects of the music - hitting the notes exactly right, or perfecting
                the rhythm cycle.</li>
            <li>Then follows the best part - infusing emotion, which brings the music alive.</li>
            <li>It allows me a glimpse into the mind of the composer and what their intentions might have been with the
                piece at hand, almost like they are whispering to me through the folds of time, teaching me to
                appreciate the beauty of the music.</li>
            <li>With repeated practice, the song embeds itself into my being - the muscle memory kicks in and my fingers
                seem to know where to go of their own accord, minimizing conscious thought on my part, and allowing me
                to truly immerse myself in the music and revel in its richness and majesty.</li>
        </ul>
